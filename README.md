# DropBlox
*JavaScript Based Drag And Drop Language*

I am working on my own drag and drop programming language, it can be found [here](http://www.ianmorrill.com/drobblox). If I continue to work it, I hope to make it more Scratch-like in nature (Stage, Sprites, etc.).

Features:
- The Following Blocks:
  - Alert _
  - Show copy box _
  - Define variable _
  - Set _ to _
  - Repeat _ Times
  - End
- Export JavaScript
- Execution via JavaScript

More blocks will be added.
