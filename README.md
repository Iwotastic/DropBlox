# DropBlox
*JavaScript Based Drag And Drop Language*

I am working on my own drag and drop programming language, it can be found [here](http://www.ianmorrill.com/dropblox). If I continue to work it, I hope to make it more Scratch-like in nature (Stage, Sprites, etc.).

**Features**
- The Following Blocks:
  - Alert _
  - Show copy box _
  - Define variable _
  - Set _ to _
  - Repeat _ Times
  - End
- Export JavaScript
- Execution via JavaScript

More blocks will be added.

**How Do I Get It!?**
There are two sites that you can use DropBlox live on. These sites are shown below.

Site | Description
--- | ---
[My Personal Website](http://www.ianmorrill.com/dropblox) | Usually updated after I commit but sometimes not.
[gh-pages](http://iwotastic.github.io/DropBlox) | As it is `gh-pages`, it is always up to date.

## Usage Guide
A guide to the nooks and crannies of DropBlox.

### Input Field Key
The key that tells you what input fields correspond to which input types.

Type | Description
--- | ---
String | White background, simi-curved borders
Entity | Grey background, simi-curved borders
Number | White background, curved borders

### Loop / C Blocks
To use a loop / C block, simply drag an `end` block after the last block you wish to be in the loop block.

### Variable Embedding
To embed a variable in a string input, surround it in double brackets. For example, if you were trying to embed a variable called `hi` then in a text inupt you would type `[[hi]]`
